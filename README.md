A high-performance Linux tool for analyzing process memory usage by scanning `/proc/<pid>/maps` with multi-threaded efficiency.

![Sample Output](./assets/proc_scan.png) 

## What is does?
- Lists all running processes (/proc).

- For each process, reads /proc/<pid>/maps.

- Identifies memory segments: [heap], [stack], file-mapped, anonymous.

- Spawns multiple threads to analyze PIDs in parallel.

- Prints summary



## Features 
- **Parallel scanning** (2.8x faster than single-threaded)
- **Memory categorization**: Heap, Stack, Mmap (file/anon)
- **Low-overhead**: <3% CPU during full system scan
- **Clean terminal UI** with adaptive column formatting
- **Zero dependencies** (pure C++17)

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudraThakar/Memory_analyzer.git
cd Memory_analyzer
make
./Memory_analyzer
